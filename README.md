# John-Lemon-Jaunt
Cheyanne Kester, Avery Meyers, and Sasha Heye

Cheyanne was responsible for the linear interpolation:
  Created an effect where the Gargoyles' flashlight colors changed 
  according to how close John Lemon was to them.
  Green for far away, and red for close enough to get caught.
  
Avery was responsible for the dot product:
  Created a PolterGus, which is a version of the Ghost that pursues
  John Lemon at specific intervals of speed, and can go through walls. 
  
Sasha was responsible for the particle effects:
  Added blue bubbles to the shower in the bathroom, and fire
  to the fireplace using the same bubble effect, but fire colored.
